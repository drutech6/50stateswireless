      Apple Watch Series 3 and Series 4 have a water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. This means that they may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. However, they should not be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, or other activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth.

      Wireless service plan required for cellular service. Apple Watch and iPhone service provider must be the same. Not available with all service providers.

      Key features Design- The iPhone 17 Pro Max features a lightweight,
      heat-forged aluminum unibody design with a two-tone finish and rounded
      edges, making it more comfortable to hold. The camera bump has been
      redesigned into a horizontal plateau that runs across the entire width of
      the phone. Display- A larger 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR display offers a
      brighter picture (up to 3000 nits peak outdoor brightness) and is
      protected by Ceramic Shield 2, which covers both the front and back for
      better scratch and crack resistance. The display also includes ProMotion
      technology with a 120Hz refresh rate and improved anti-reflection
      properties. Processor- It is equipped with the A19 Pro chip, which
      provides significant performance improvements and is optimized for
      advanced AI features through its Neural Accelerators. A new vapor chamber
      cooling system helps the phone maintain higher performance for longer.
      Cameras- The rear camera system features three *Fusion* cameras, all with
      48MP sensors. The telephoto lens now offers 8x optical zoom, a substantial
      improvement over previous models. The front-facing camera has also been
      upgraded to an 18MP square sensor that supports Center Stage, allowing for
      landscape selfies while holding the phone vertically. Battery- The new
      internal design allows for a larger battery, providing the best-ever
      battery life in an iPhone. It also supports faster wired charging,
      reaching 50% in 20 minutes with a compatible 40W adapter. Connectivity- An
      Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip (N1) is included, promising better performance
      and reliability for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
